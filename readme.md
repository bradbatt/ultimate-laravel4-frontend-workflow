### The Ultimate Laravel 4 + Bootstrap 3 + GruntJS with LiveReload

#### How to use - instruction
1. Copy all the files and folders to the root directory of your Laravel 4 project.
2. Run `$ npm install (or sudo npm install on Linux or OSX) from the root of your project. This will install all the required dependancies.
3. Add the stylesheets and scripts below to your projects view files. NOTE: The last script 'livereload.js' is only optional if you already have the livereload plugin already installed for Chrome/FireFox !!
4. Finally: Run `$ grunt watch:bs3` to start watching for file changes. If a change occurs livereload will kick in and update your browser.
5. All done! You can edit any of your Laravel view files, Bootstrap 3 LESS, CSS or JS files, and livereload should kick in.
